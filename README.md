This is a module for the [Module Off][moduleoff] competition on 1/10/13. It
adds an option to all date field formatters to include a button that changes
the value of the field to the current date and time.

For instructions on how to use it, see the [screencast][screencast] explaining
its usage and how I wrote it.
